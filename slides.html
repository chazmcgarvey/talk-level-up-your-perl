## Use [`B::Deparse`](https://metacpan.org/pod/B::Deparse).

???
- `B::Deparse` is a backend module for the compiler.
- It takes the parse tree after compiling and generates Perl code from it.

So, why compile Perl only to turn it back into Perl?
It is useful for checking that perl and you are both understanding the code the same way.

---
class: ex-deparse

## Example of `B::Deparse`.

```bash
perl -MO=Deparse,-p -e'$a && not $b && not $c'
*($a and not(($b && (!$c))));
-e syntax OK
```

--
```bash
perl -MO=Deparse,-p -e'$a && ! $b && ! $c'
*(($a and not($b)) and not($c));
-e syntax OK
```

???
- These example snippets demonstrate an actual bug found in real code.

- The first snippet is mixing high and low-precedence logical operators. Comparing the output of Deparse, it's fairly
  clear to see that these are not doing the same thing.

- Deparse supports other flags that may be useful. Read the pod to find out more.

- Aside: Be careful about mixing high and low-precedence logical operators.

## Know regular expressions.

???
- Like, really know them.
- I meet a lot of people who don't know regexp.

---
class: center, middle

### It's easy.

???
- But they're easy!
- All you have to do in order to read and write regular expressions *without looking at a help resource every time* is
  know a few basic things.

---
class: center, middle

### Two basic parts:

# (what to match) (how many to match)

???
- Regular expressions let you match strings.
- Find out "does a string follow a specific pattern".

---
### What to match: Literals

- Match a specific character
- `a`
- `7`
- `~`
- `Ã¿`
- `\^`
- `\t`

---
### What to match: Character classes

- Match a character within a set
- `[a-z-]`
- `[^0-9]`
- `[q]`
- `\h`
- `[[:digit:]]`
- `.`
- `\X`

---
### How many to match: Quantifiers

- Match a certain number of the preceding single character or character class
- `*` - zero or more
- `+` - one or more
- `?` - zero or one
- `{2}`
- `{2,}`

---
class: center, middle

# (what to match) (how many to match)

???
- That's it!

---
class: center, middle

## Okay, there is more...

???
- But if you know just those concepts, you can already read a large number of regexp that you'll come across.

---
### Boundaries

- Look for the edges surrounding or between things
- `^`
- `$`
- `\b`
- `\b{sb}` - sentence boundary
- `\b{gcb}`

???
I say "look for" instead of "match" because the boundary isn't something that shows up in the results.

---
### The pipe

- Match this or that
- `cat|dog`

---
### Groups

- Separate the regexp into logical chunks
- `(blah)`
- `(?:whatever)` - noncapturing

---
### Backreferences

- Match something again
- `\1`
- `\2`
- etc.

---
### Lookaround

- Require presence of something without actually matching it
- `(?=regexp)` and `(?!regexp)` - lookahead
- `(?<=regexp)` and `(?<!regexp)` - lookbehind

???
These are zero-length assertions. Like boundaries, these don't actually match anything; they just make sure something is
or isn't present at the position where it exists relative to its surroundings.

---
class: center, middle

## Use [`Regexp::Debugger`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Regexp::Debugger).

---
class: ex-regexpdebugger

```perl
use Regexp::Debugger;

my $not_png_or_jpg = qr/(?<!\.(png|jpg))$/;
my $filename = 'log.txt';

$filename =~ $not_png_or_jpg;
```

---
class: ex-regexpdebugger

```perl
*use Regexp::Debugger;

my $not_png_or_jpg = qr/(?<!\.(png|jpg))$/;
my $filename = 'log.txt';

$filename =~ $not_png_or_jpg;
```

--
![Regexp::Debugger in action](img/regexp_debugger.png)

---
class: regexpdebugger-commands

## Things you can do with Regexp::Debugger

--
- The basics: step forward ("s") and backwards ("-").

--
- Hit "d" to get a detailed description of the regexp:

```text
    (?<!                  Match negative lookbehind
      \.                    Match a literal '.' character
      (                     The start of a capturing block ($1)
        png                   Match a literal sequence ("png")
      |                     Or...
        jpg                   Match a literal sequence ("jpg")
      )                     The end of $1
    )                     The end of negative lookbehind
    $                     Match only if at end of string (or final newline)
```

--
- Try different modes, like "e" for event log.

--
- Hit "?" for help.

--
- Hit "q" to exit the debugger.

---
class: center, middle

### Also, check out [PPR](https://metacpan.org/pod/PPR).

???
This module was brought to us by Damian Conway. Speaking of, if your interest in regular expressions continues, check
out this module. `PPR` is a packaged regular expression with subpatterns that can match Perl code.

Really cool stuff.

## Write Vim plugins in Perl.

---
class: center, middle

### It's easy.

---
class: ex-vimcheck, center, middle

### Does your Vim support Perl?

```bash
vim --version |grep +perl && echo 'Aww yeah!'
```

???
Some minimal builds of Vim do not have Perl support compiled in.
Check with this.

---
class: ex-vimcheck, center, middle

### You'll need this...

```bash
:h usr_41
```

Chapter 41 in the Vim manual is all about scripting.

---
class: ex-vim

```perl
function! color#random()
    let l:colorlist = globpath(&rtp, "colors/*.vim")
    perl <<END
my ($result, $colors) = VIM::Eval("l:colorlist");
return if $result != 1;
my @available_colors = split(/\n/, $colors);
my %bad_colors = eval {
    open(my $fh, '<', "$ENV{HOME}/.vim/color_blacklist.txt");
    map { chomp; ($_ => 1) } <$fh>;
};
for (my $tries = 0; $tries < 100; ++$tries) {
    my $colorpath = $available_colors[int(rand(@available_colors))];
    my ($color) = $colorpath =~ m!([^/]+)\.vim!;
    if (!$bad_colors{$color}) {
        VIM::DoCommand("colorscheme $color");
        last;
    }
}
END
endfunction
```

---
class: ex-vim

```perl
*function! color#random()
*   let l:colorlist = globpath(&rtp, "colors/*.vim")
*   perl <<END
my ($result, $colors) = VIM::Eval("l:colorlist");
return if $result != 1;
my @available_colors = split(/\n/, $colors);
my %bad_colors = eval {
    open(my $fh, '<', "$ENV{HOME}/.vim/color_blacklist.txt");
    map { chomp; ($_ => 1) } <$fh>;
};
for (my $tries = 0; $tries < 100; ++$tries) {
    my $colorpath = $available_colors[int(rand(@available_colors))];
    my ($color) = $colorpath =~ m!([^/]+)\.vim!;
    if (!$bad_colors{$color}) {
        VIM::DoCommand("colorscheme $color");
        last;
    }
}
*END
*endfunction
```

???
This is Vimscript.

---
class: ex-vim

```perl
function! color#random()
    let l:colorlist = globpath(&rtp, "colors/*.vim")
    perl <<END
*my ($result, $colors) = VIM::Eval("l:colorlist");
return if $result != 1;
my @available_colors = split(/\n/, $colors);
my %bad_colors = eval {
    open(my $fh, '<', "$ENV{HOME}/.vim/color_blacklist.txt");
    map { chomp; ($_ => 1) } <$fh>;
};
for (my $tries = 0; $tries < 100; ++$tries) {
    my $colorpath = $available_colors[int(rand(@available_colors))];
    my ($color) = $colorpath =~ m!([^/]+)\.vim!;
    if (!$bad_colors{$color}) {
*       VIM::DoCommand("colorscheme $color");
        last;
    }
}
END
endfunction
```

???
By the way, Vim supports embedded interpreters for other languages like Python, Ruby, and Lua in similar fashion.

## Document your shell scripts with pod.

---
class: ex-shellpod

```bash
#!/bin/sh

: <<'=cut'
=head1 NAME

therapist.sh - This script can save you a bunch of cash

=cut

echo 'Hello. Now, tell me about your problems.'

while read response
do
    printf "Patient said: %s" "$response" >>therapist_notes.txt

    echo 'And how did that make you feel?'
done

echo "Goodbye! Let's meet again in two weeks."
```

---
class: ex-shellpod

```bash
#!/bin/sh

: <<'=cut'
*=head1 NAME
*
*therapist.sh - This script can save you a bunch of cash
*
*=cut

echo 'Hello. Now, tell me about your problems.'

while read response
do
    printf "Patient said: %s" "$response" >>therapist_notes.txt

    echo 'And how did that make you feel?'
done

echo "Goodbye! Let's meet again in two weeks."
```

???
It's pod! In a shell script.

---
class: ex-shellpod

```bash
#!/bin/sh

*: <<'=cut'
=head1 NAME

therapist.sh - This script can save you a bunch of cash

=cut

echo 'Hello. Now, tell me about your problems.'

while read response
do
    printf "Patient said: %s" "$response" >>therapist_notes.txt

    echo 'And how did that make you feel?'
done

echo "Goodbye! Let's meet again in two weeks."
```

???
This is the key right here. Anybody know what this is?

It's a heredoc.

The colon command in bourne shell is just noop. Sometimes you'll see the colon used as a type of comment, but unlike
a comment the shell does parse the arguments to colon.

class: center, middle

## Understand calling context.

???
- One of the baffling things about Perl5 to newcomers is that subroutines can
 do different things based on *where* they are used. This is called context.

---
## The three main contexts:
- Scalar
- List
- Void

---
## The wantarray() function
- True if caller called in **list** context.
- False if **scalar** context.
- `undef` if **void** context.

???
Unfortunately this function was misnamed. It should have been "wantlist" since
there really is no "array context."

---
class: ex-context

## Example: localtime()

```perl
@time = localtime();    # -> (1, 43, 13, 7, 5, 118, 4, 157, 1)
$time = localtime();    # -> "Thu Jun  7 13:43:01 2018"
```

---
class: ex-context

## Operators help determine context.

--
```perl
$thing_one . $thing_two
```

???
String concatenation is a scalar thing, so the concat operator "creates" a scalar context on either side.

--
```perl
$income - $expenses
```

???
Numerical and comparison operators typically operator in the same way. So that's easy.

--
### Scalar context on both sides.

---
class: ex-context

## Operators help determine context.

```perl
!ready()
```

```perl
$count++
```

### Also evaluated in scalar context.

???
- Generally the prefix and postfix operators also create scalar context.

---
class: center, middle

## The assignment operator... is different.

???
What makes it different is that the assignment operator is really two different
operators in Perl 5.

---
class: ex-context2

## The scalar assignment operator

```perl
$scalar = $another_scalar;      # copy scalar on the right to the left
```

--
```perl
$scalar = @array;
```

---
class: ex-context2

## The scalar assignment operator

```perl
$scalar = $another_scalar;      # copy scalar on the right to the left
```

```perl
$scalar = @array;               # $scalar => length of @array
```

---
class: ex-context2

## The scalar assignment operator

```perl
$scalar = $another_scalar;      # copy scalar on the right to the left
```

```perl
$scalar = @array;               # $scalar => length of @array
```

```perl
$scalar = qw(list of things);
```

---
class: ex-context2

## The scalar assignment operator

```perl
$scalar = $another_scalar;      # copy scalar on the right to the left
```

```perl
$scalar = @array;               # $scalar => length of @array
```

```perl
$scalar = qw(list of things);   # $scalar => "things"
```

--
### Lists and arrays are **not** the same thing!

---
class: ex-context2

## The list assignment operator

```perl
@array = @another_array;        # copy array on the right to the left
```

--
```perl
@array = $scalar;
```

---
class: ex-context2

## The list assignment operator

```perl
@array = @another_array;        # copy array on the right to the left
```

```perl
@array = $scalar;               # $scalar copied; @array has one item
```

--
```perl
@array = qw(list of things);    # contents of list copied to @array
```

---
class: ex-context

## Subroutines determine context of their parameters.

```perl
sub i_can_haz_scalar :prototype($) {
    say @_;
}

my @arr = qw(foo bar baz);
*i_can_haz_scalar(@arr);
```

???
Not only can subroutines branch and do different things based on the context
that calls them -- based on `wantarray()` -- they also control the context of
their parameters.

---
class: ex-context

## Subroutines determine context of their parameters.

```perl
sub i_can_haz_scalar :prototype($) {
    say @_;
}

my @arr = qw(foo bar baz);
*i_can_haz_scalar(@arr);         # => 3
```

---
class: ex-context

## Subroutines determine context of their parameters.

```perl
sub i_can_haz_scalar :prototype($) {
    say @_;
}

*i_can_haz_scalar(qw{2 4 6 8});
```

---
class: ex-context

## Subroutines determine context of their parameters.

```perl
sub i_can_haz_scalar :prototype($) {
    say @_;
}

*i_can_haz_scalar(qw{2 4 6 8});  # => 8
```

???
Remember: Arrays and lists are no the same thing!

---
class: ex-context

## Be vigilant.

```perl
my %account_details = (
    first_name  => (split / /, $user_name)[0],
    job_title   => fetch_job_title($user_name),
);
```

???
The reason it is important to understand contexts is because you will get
caught by gotchas if you don't.

Spot any potential problems here?

---
class: ex-context

## Be vigilant.

```perl
my %account_details = (
    first_name  => (split / /, $user_name)[0],
*   job_title   => fetch_job_title($user_name),
);
```

```perl
sub fetch_job_title {
    return;     # -> ()
}
```

--
### Can use the `scalar` function to force scalar context.

```perl
    job_title   => scalar fetch_job_title($user_name),
```

---
class: ex-context

## Be vigilant.

```perl
my %account_details = (
*   first_name  => (split / /, $user_name)[0],
    job_title   => fetch_job_title($user_name),
);
```

### `(split /regexp/, $str)[$index]` can evaluate to `()`!

???
This is surprising, right? Usually when you have a post-circumfix index
operator on either a list or an array, even if you go out of bounds you'll get
an `undef`.

I should also mention that not only can things like this cause bugs that are
annoying and hard to find, there are security implications. If you're not aware
of how all the code within a hash declaration responds to being in list
context, you could potentially open the door for crafted user input to
overwrite completely unrelated keys in the hash.

---
class: center, middle

## Understand execution phases.

---
## Two main phases

- **Compile** phase
- **Run** phase

???
That's easy enough. What's to know, right?

Well, it turns out that it's not so straightforward because unlike many other
languages, Perl can run code in the compile phase and compile code in the run
phase.

---
class: ex-phases

## Example script

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

print "O hai.\n";
```

---
class: ex-phases

## Example script

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

*print "O hai.\n";
```

???
By the time this line executes we are already in the **run** phase.

So how do you actually run code in the compile phase?

---
class: ex-phases

## Run code in compile phase

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

print "O hai.\n";

*BEGIN {
*   print "Hello.\n";
*}
```

```
Hello.
O hai.
```

???
One way to run code in the compile phase is to create a `BEGIN` block.

---
class: ex-phases

## Run code in compile phase

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

*use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);

print Dumper({
    picard  => 'jean-luc',
    kirk    => 'james',
});
```

???
`use` statements are also fulfilled in the compile phase, so it doesn't matter
where they appear within the code.

Similarly, `no` statements are also performed at compile time.

--
```perl
BEGIN {
    require Data::Dumper;
    Data::Dumper->import('Dumper');
}
```

???
A `use` statement is *almost* the equivalent of this here.

Also worth pointing out, the fact that code can be ran during the compile phase means that using the `-c` flag on an
untrusted script is not advised.

---
class: ex-phases

## Compile code in run phase

--
### String `eval`!

```perl
my $calculate_answer = eval q[
    sub {
        return ] . ($hgttg ? 42 : 7) . q[;
    }
];

print "The answer is ", $calculate_answer->(), ".\n";
```

???
String `eval` both compiles and runs strings as Perl code.

It gets a bad rap because of its security implications. Yes, generating code to compile and run on the fly, when based
on user input, must be done very carefully or not at all.

This technique is used by many Perl modules to "inline" optimized versions of their subroutines. For example, `Moo` and
`Moose` can generate constructors tailored for each class rather than always using one big constructor that can is able
to handle all the possibilities.

---
## Code blocks associated with execution phases

- `BEGIN` - Runs the block immediately after it is compiled.

--
- `CHECK` - Runs the block after the main compile phase and before the main run phase.

--
- `CHECKUNIT` - Same, but for each "unit" (file).

--
- `INIT` - Runs the block immediately before the main run phase.

--
- `END` - Runs the block at program end.

Source: [Know the phases of a Perl programâs execution](https://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/2011/03/know-the-phases-of-a-perl-programs-execution/) by brian d foy

???
By the way, it runs the blocks in a defined order, which is nice: `BEGIN` and `INIT` run in top to bottom order, while
the others run in the opposite order.

---
class: center, middle

## Know when to be terse and when not to.

---
class: ex-obfuscated, center, middle

```perl
@P=split//,".URRUU\c8R";@d=split//,"\nrekcah xinU / lreP rehtona tsuJ";sub p{
@p{"r$p","u$p"}=(P,P);pipe"r$p","u$p";++$p;($q*=2)+=$f=!fork;map{$P=$P[$f^ord

close$_}%p;wait until$?;map{/^r/&&<$_>}%p;$_=$d[$q];sleep rand(2)if/\S/;print
```

Source: [Just Another Perl / Unix Hacker](http://perl.plover.com/obfuscated/) by Mark Jason Dominus

???
This is what terse code looks like. At least I think it is... If I knew what it was doing, I would probably conclude
that it is in fact terse.

But actually, it might not be. For all I know this could be a very roundabout and verbose way to accomplish the work
it's doing. I can't tell because it's too "obfuscated."

---
class: center, middle

# obfuscation â  terseness

???
The concepts of obfuscation and terseness are not materially equivalent.

Obfuscation is always bad (except in "toy" code like "Just another hacker" snippets and obfuscation challenges).
Terseness can be bad (if it's too obfuscated for the audience), but sometimes it can be better.

---
class: ex-terse

## Be terse without obfuscating

- Be idiomatic.

```perl
@coordinates = @geodata[2, 3];
@coordinates = ($geodata[2], $geodata[3]);
$coordinates[0] = $geodata[2]; $coordinates[1] = $geodata[3]; 
```

???
Some language features are so common, they are idiomatic among users of the language even if the code may be somewhat
perplexing to newcomers.

Here are three more-or-less equivalent ways to do the same thing. The first way, using and array slice, is
definitionally the tersest. Is it too terse? Is it obfuscated?

In my subjective opinion, all three of these statements are equally fine. Array slicing is a language feature of Perl
that doesn't exist in every other language, so it might perplex newcomers for a bit, but I think the intent is pretty
clear even for those new to the syntax.

So this is a great place to be terse.

--
- Terse code can actually be faster for humans to parse.

???
If only because there's less to read.

--
- Talk to your peers (or downstream "users") and establish expectations.

???
Some language features and style may just be too perplexing, so pay attention to who will probably be working with your
code in the future.

You don't always have to code for the lowest possible common denominator.

Example: A lot of code could be written in the functional style versus imperatively. Keep in mind that functional code
is easier to read and write for math-minded programmers. Perl can do either, but which one you choose should depend more
on who else is going to be working in your code rather than your own personal preference.

--
- But **never** ever sacrifice clarity of intent for shorter code.

???
Anyway, I don't have any solid wisdom for you on this topic. Just be mindful.

---
class: center, middle

## Use [`Future::AsyncAwait`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Future::AsyncAwait).

???
If you have used JavaScript recently, you may have used its "async/await" feature to clean up your non-blocking code.

---
class: center, middle

### Yes, Perl can do it, too!

---
class: ex-asyncawait

## Without async and await

```perl
use Future;

sub do_two_things {
    return do_first_thing()->then(sub {
        my $first = shift;

        return do_second_thing($first)->then(sub {
            my $second = shift;

            return Future->done([$first, $second]);
        });
    });
}
```

---
class: ex-asyncawait

## With async and await

```perl
use Future::AsyncAwait;

async sub do_two_things
{
    my $first = await do_first_thing();
 
    my $second = await do_second_thing($first);
 
    return [$first, $second];
}
```

???
There are caveats: Localized variable assignments don't work, nor anything that has implied local-like behavior.

---
class: center, middle

## Write your own boilerplate.

---
class: ex-boilerplate

### The boilerplate can get unwieldy...

```perl
package My::Package;

use utf8;
use warnings FATAL => 'all';
use strict;
use feature ':5.14';
use open qw(:encoding(UTF-8) :std);
use charnames qw(:full :short);

use Encoding qw(decode encode);
use Function::Parameters;
use Locale::TextDomain 'AppName';
use Scalar::Util qw(blessed refaddr reftype weaken unweaken isweak);
use Unicode::Normalize qw(NFC NFC);
```

In every file.

---
class: center, middle

### Solution: Put all that junk in a separate package.

---
class: ex-boilerplate2

```perl
package My::boilerplate;

use Import::Into;

sub import {
    my $class  = shift;
    my %args   = @_;

    my $target = caller;

    feature     ->import::into($target, qw{:5.14});

### Use your boilerplate.

```perl
package My::Package;

use My::boilerplate;

sub say_hello {
    say __"Hello";
}

1;
```

???
Now I can use `say` without having to use perl 5.10 in my package, and I can use gettext to translate my greeting.
Warnings and strict are also enabled. All that stuff I need in every module is there.

```ini

## Write your own debugger.

???
Perl provides rather convenient mechanisms for hooking into the interpreter.

The idea for this topic, by the way, is from a lightning talk by rjbs in YAPC 2014. His talks are always entertaining,
so look them up.

---
class: ex-owndebugger1

```bash
perl -d:MyFancyDebugger program.pl
```

???
This does at least two important things.

--
### `use Devel::MyFancyDebugger;`
### `$^P = 1855;`

???
`$^P` is a bitfield that lets you turn on and off various features related to debugging. The value 1855 isn't important;
just know that using this flag turns on a lot of those bits.

---
class: ex-owndebugger2

```perl
package Devel::PackageOrder;

my %seen;

{
    package DB;
    sub DB {
        my ($package, $filename, $line) = caller;
        return if $seen{$package}++;
        print STDERR "Package: $package\n";
    }
}

1;
```

```bash
perl -d:PackageOrder program.pl
```

???
As it happens, the second bit of `$^P` arranges for a subroutine named `DB::DB` to be called per statement. 

---
class: ex-owndebugger2

```perl
package Devel::PackageOrder;

my %seen;

{
*   package DB;
*   sub DB {
        my ($package, $filename, $line) = caller;
        return if $seen{$package}++;
        print STDERR "Package: $package\n";
    }
}

1;
```

```bash
perl -d:PackageOrder program.pl
```

???
So, for each statement that gets run in your program, this subroutine is called. My simple example here just does some
simple things. It uses the `caller` function to figure out where the program is at in its execution.

The first item we get off of `caller` is the package name (actually we could also just call `caller` in scalar context
to get just the package). Then, if we've seen the package before, we don't do anything, otherwise we print the name of
the package.

So, this effectively tells us in what order packages 

Is this useful? I don't know. I guess it useful at some point because I wrote it. The point is, you can write your own
debuggers to do whatever useful thing you have need of, when you have the need.

And by the way, I've shown you the entirety of the debugger. There is no other code needed. It's really cool.

Of course those other debuggers are cool, but don't forget that perl also comes with its own general-purpose debugger.
You should know it.

Obviously you can use it to step through code.

no warnings qw(experimental::signatures);

my $missile_inventory = {
    ID  => 20,

    die "Silo is empty.\n" if $missile_inventory->{$silo_id} <= 0;
    $missile_inventory->{$silo_id} -= 1;
    say "Missile launched from silo $silo_id.";

### Postfix dereferencing

```perl
use v5.24;

my $person = {
    name => 'Bob',
    associates => [
        {
            name => 'Karen',
        },
        {
            name => 'Doug',
        },
    ],
}

my @others = $person->{associates}->@*;
my %associate_attributes = $person->{associates}->@[0]->%*;
```

### `@{...}` can be `->@*` at the end
### `%{...}` can be `->%*` at the end

---
class: ex-newfeatures2

### Subroutine signatures

```perl
use v5.20;
use feature qw(signatures);
no warnings qw(experimental::signatures);

sub other_args_allowed_and_ignored($foo, @) {
}

sub positional_and_named($args, %other) {
}

# etc.
```

---
class: ex-newfeatures2

### Strip leading space in heredocs

```perl
use v5.26;

do {
    print <<~'HERE';
    Hi. The text here is indented in the source code,
    but not in the console!
    HERE;
};
```

---
class: ex-moo

## Use [`Moo`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) and [`Moose`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose).

```perl
package ToySoldier;

use Function::Parameters;
use Moo;
use namespace::clean;

extends 'Toy';

with qw(HasSpear);

method fight($opponent) {
    $self->spear->thrust_at($opponent);
}

1;
```

???
- Gives perl5 an improved object model.
- It partially is just syntactic sugar, right? But these modules do provide a lot of value about perl5's own object
  model.
  - Attributes and a constructor.
  - Roles (a.k.a. mixins).
  - And if you use Moose, you get the whole metaobject as well.
    - The metaobject provides introspection and runtime altering of classes. It's powerful.

I'm not going to go any further into Moo or Moose, but do learn them and use them with a caveat: I don't know how anyone
else feels about this, but I kinda like modules on CPAN that don't depend on Moo or especially Moose, because modules
with fewer dependencies are just easier to work with generally. So, if you are releasing on CPAN, consider not depending
on this. Or at least use Moo and not full Moose if you don't actually need the metaobject. Of course, in your own
non-distributed programs, go all out.

```

---
class: ex-perl6

### Meta operators

```perl
[*] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5           # -> 120
```

???
- This one is called the **reduce** meta operator.
- Also notice that in Perl 6, you don't need to surround a list in parentheses.

--
```perl
sub some-reducer($a, $b) { $a + $b }

[[&some-reducer]] 1 .. 5    # -> 15
[+] 1 .. 5                  # -> 15
```

???
- Can reduce using any binary operator.
- Oh yeah, and you can use dashes in subroutine names.

---
class: ex-perl6

### Meta operators

```perl
1, 3 ... 9
2, 4, 8 ... 256
```

???
You've seen the dot dot operator, but check out dot dot dot!

---
class: ex-perl6

### Meta operators

```perl
1, 3 ... 9                  # -> 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
2, 4, 8 ... 256             # -> 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
```

--
```perl
my @fib = 1, 1, -> $a, $b { $a + $b } ... *;

@fib[6]                     # -> 13
@fib[3 .. 5]                # -> 3, 5, 8
@fib[^8]                    # -> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
```

???
- Of course you can do even awesomer things like create infinite lists with more complicated sequence logic.
- The list elements are evaluated lazily.

---
class: ex-perl6

### Create your own operators

```perl
sub postfix:<!>(Int $n) { [*] 2 .. $n }

5!                          # -> 120
```

???
Lots of languages (even perl5) allows you to override operators, but none come close to perl6 in functionality.

--

Types of operators you can create in Perl 6:

- Prefix (like `!` as in `!True`)
- Postfix (like `++` in `$num++`)
- Infix (like `+` in `1 + 2`)
- Circumfix (like `[]` in `[1, 2]`)
- Post-circumfix (like `[]` in `@array[5]`)

---
class: ex-perl6

### Destructure your structures

```perl
sub salut(% (:name($name), :title($title))) {
    say "Hello there, $name the $title!";
}

salut({name => 'Bob', title => 'Consultant'});

my %person = {name => 'Jean Luc', title => 'Captain'};
salut(%person);
```

???
I guess the first thing to say is that, yes, Perl 6 has function signatures.

As this example shows, you can also do nifty stuff like destructure.

---

### Other cool stuff in Perl 6

- Sigils that make [more] sense.

--
- A real object model.

--
- Types! -- If you want.

--
- Multiple dispatch for subroutines.

--
- Control over passing semantics.

???
- Args are immutable by default, but can be set to copy or be mutable (like perl5 aliasing).

--
- Lambdas
